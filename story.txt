There once was a badger who was wandering through wisconsin.
He tried his best to go unnoticed while wandering around until he found a new
city. It seemed to come out of nowhere. One moment he was in a corn field, the
next...
He was in a train. The badger knew that his only effective means of traveling
throughout Wisconsin was public transportation, but it meant that it would be
easier to be caught. His ability to not be caught while traveling was a result
of his unique skill in...
Camoflague, Bucky could seemingly dissapear into thin air. He was on the run from the zombies created by the corona virus. Being a badger meant he was immujne but all the humans he had grown to love turned into zombies and tried to eat him. After the trains stopped running the 80 was the only form of transportation he had left. One day he got off and saw...
a zombie staring right into his eyes. That instant Bucky knew that the zombie wanted his brains. He took off running and being a badger, Bucky could easily outrun the zombie and he managed to reach safety in Memorial Union.
